Exemplo 1:
THIS HOTEL DOES NOT ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I made a reservation at this hotel for one night to celebrate my birthday. Unfortunately I have a disability that requires a special assistance medical service dog that was denied by this hotel. Furthermore the staff was very rude when talking to my partner and I. Their behavior is quite shameful and I hope no one else has to feel as disrespected and worthless as they made me feel.

AMAZINGGGGGGG!
I can't even begin to tell how wonderful my experience at the fera were! I mean, there are one too many wonderful things to talk about. Let's start with the staff. From the moment I walk into to the hotel I was welcome by the AMAZING from desk of the year, Lu aka Luciana. I mean, she was so friendly and super efficient on making quick decisions. She was able to put me in a room the fit all my needs and, she did an AMAZING job. I also want to give an especial shoutout to the absolutely amazing Daniela (the gerente de hospedagem) That girl is on fire!!! She is just such an amazing human being. She, like Lu, is very loving and caring
